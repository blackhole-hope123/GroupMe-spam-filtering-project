This has not been a problem in the past, as the Blackburn House rec room has three tables.\n\nTo our new members who have not attended a meeting before, we are a recreational club intended for anyone who enjoys playing or is interested in learning how to play pool. There are no fees to join, as we rely on the use of the university's pool equipment and that brought by members.\n\nAlso! I encourage everyone to stop by the OSU Student Involvement Fair this Sunday, the 28th. It's the best opportunity there is to find new student organizations.
