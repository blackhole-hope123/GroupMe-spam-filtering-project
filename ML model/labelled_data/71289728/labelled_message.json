This includes 6 hours of classroom time and 2 hours of range time.\n\nFor those of you interested in getting your CCW in the near future this class is necessary for you. It is essentially a pre-requisite to the CCW qualification process that you would get at a range somewhere. It is necessary to have a certification in this before being able to get your CCW. \n\nIt is about $80ish (which is reasonable compared to other range pricing) the certification is included. If you have your own gun you are encouraged to bring it, however if you do not have one he has a few. You will need to bring about 100-150 rounds for the range time. If you are interested dm me separately and I can work on getting you signed up. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t 21 don\u2019t worry! The certification lasts for 3 years. \n",
