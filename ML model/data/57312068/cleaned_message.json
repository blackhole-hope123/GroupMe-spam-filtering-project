  "I usually win bc ppl hit the 8ball in the wrong hole hehehe ",
  "sorry my stroke game is weak",
  "Most of the time, you don't really even have to hit real hard to break it up fairly well. It's mostly about hitting with a good stroke at first. Power comes with time and confidence as you refine your stroke",
  "i hit the cue and it slightly moves maybe one or two balls but never enough to actually break the whole thing",
  "I'll be bringing some loaner cues down if anyone wants a personal one to use, especially since the dorm cues generally have no tips, etc. ",

  "Yeah, the RPAC tables are in the lounge on the bottom floor. They have 2 of them. The cues there actually have tips too, unlike almost all the dorm cues. If you two wanted to go earlier, you only need your BuckID to get in. This line will go fairly fast honestly, only takes like 5-10 mins tops",
  "i\u2019m guessing it\u2019ll be around 530 cuz the line at scott is long as hell. unless h wanna head up there now and we can get some games in before Nick is available",

  "If you can do it later*",
  "I can in a bit. I'm going to eat at Scott once they open in 5 mins, then I'd have to head back to my dorm and grab my cues. Where would you be playing?",

  "I guess being a good player consists of skill and style.",
  "Probably helps having the smaller tip too, I agree. I'm guessing that's how players with snooker cues (even pool players have some) can get significant screw shots and replicating them with our cues is virtually impossible",
  "I see. I was thinking physically, a smaller tip would apply more precise pressure on the point of the ball you were trying to strike while a larger tip would take up more surface area and therefore be less effective. It must be a combination of both cue size and ball size. ",
  "Trying to find info about tournaments especially times when people were playing before that site was around was a nightmare",
  "Snooker.org is the best site ever created",
  "The cues help be more precise, not adding extra side especially. It's hard to tell with larger tips if you added a fraction of a tip left or right. I'm almost certain the spin has to do with the size of the balls; if you took Physics, it has to do with angular momentum. It's easier to get something to spin faster when it's smaller. Same premise here",
  "Is it because of the balls or the smaller tips on the cues?  Idk cause I've seen pool players with snooker cues before",
  "It's nice how much easier it is to get spin on those balls though",
  "I've heard 12 x 6 feet. Plus smaller pockets and smaller balls. It's wild how they make those crazy shots. Snooker players make it seem so much easier than it really is ",
  "Nevermind, must've misread something. It's scary all around. ",
  "Only 10 ft in US, 1 ft longer than 9-ball tables. Europe is 12 ft, those scare me",
  "The pockets are so tiny",
  "Snooker players are unbelievable. The size of that table alone makes me tremble",
  "Here's a good snooker calendar\nhttp://www.snooker.org/res/index.asp?template=2",
  "Snooker players are built different ",
  "Awesome, I'm definitely more interested in watching 8 ball and snooker. I'll definitely search that up and see what I can find tho as I've always been interested in watching live games ",
  "There's different ones for different types. You'll find various calendars for 8-ball, 9-ball, 10-ball, one-pocket, and snooker. I'd recommend simply looking up \"x calendar\" on google, you'll find different leagues posting their calendar(s). I haven't personally seen a general consolidated one, but some tournament organizers/leagues will put multiple games into the same calendar (ex. 9 and 10 ball are often lumped together)",

  "Greetings, Billiards Club members! I hope you all had a great summer. Our first official meeting of the semester will be held on Sunday, September 4, at 3pm in the Blackburn Dorm House.\n\nPlease be aware that as guests using residence hall facilities, the residents of the building have first priority over the space and use of the pool tables. This has not been a problem in the past, as the Blackburn House rec room has three tables.\n\nTo our new members who have not attended a meeting before, we are a recreational club intended for anyone who enjoys playing or is interested in learning how to play pool. There are no fees to join, as we rely on the use of the university's pool equipment and that brought by members.\n\nAlso! I encourage everyone to stop by the OSU Student Involvement Fair this Sunday, the 28th. It's the best opportunity there is to find new student organizations.

  "Yea for sure!",
  "^^^",
  "Free good pool table would be good for smaller group tho",
  "true. an occasional get together at a pool hall could be fun tho",
  "^^",
  "I personally feel like it would be better tho to stay on campus and possibly try expanding pool there",
  "Also the last pool club that existed got Suzy Cues to give them a free table once a week... so if we want to go down that route that is also a possibility",
  "@trent I haven\u2019t personally been there but I know a few people that have played there and they say it\u2019s good",

  "Also how many of you guys will be actually be willing to attend Dr. Kilcup\u2019s pool physics clinic if it\u2019s held at Patterson...?",
  "anyone been here?",
  "Zach did have a nice idea where if we do have too many people for 2 tables and we haven\u2019t gotten more table for the rpac we could just split up and have little divisions in different dorms",
  "Thats the president we need",
  "I agree I would like to see the club grow",
  "The scratchers lol",
  "PB club",
  "Also if anyone has any good names for the club feel free to suggest",
  "Nah prob not. I just named this chat that cause that\u2019s technically the name of the club atm. Once we change the name of the club we can just change the groupme name",
  "But like I think it\u2019ll be cool if we go. It\u2019ll also be a way to get relations with him better",
  "Btw are we gonna keep the name pocket billiards club?",
  "(Lol ik that sounds kinda extra)",
  "And btw I\u2019ve been talking a bit with Dr. Kilcup (he\u2019s prob gonna be the advisor for our club) and he said that he would like to have a little physics demonstration showing us the physics of pool",
  "What\u2019s good prez",
  "Ofc feel free to add anyone to the groupme who wants to join ",
  "Yo yo so here is the beginning of the pool club. Since the club isn\u2019t technically a thing yet we can just use this chat as an informal way to just see if anyone wants to play for now"
