Let me introduce myself: I’m Noah, the treasurer of piano club. We’re currently working with Sullivant Hall’s building management team to reserve a space for this year. We are hoping to have bi-weekly meetings in the Sullivant Hall Collaboratory on Thursday 6:30-8 (ish), but day/time is subject to change based on building availability. \n\nLast semester, we around a piano and played piano for each other. We’re planning on having themes (like Disney, classical, etc) to our meetings for this year. Additionally, we are working on setting up some sort of piano lessons for those who are new to piano and want to learn! \n\nBe on the lookout for announcements about our first meeting once the day and time is set in stone! As always, feel free to ask me, our president @Jack Toadvine, and our VP @Emily McCormick and questions you may have :)","user_id":"45177344","platform":"gm","pinned_at":null,"pinned_by":"","reactions":[{"type":"unicode","user_ids":["109870104","52294269","59089072","71633024","72803922","79745274","92790371"],"code":"❤️"}]},{"attachments":[{"type":"reply","user_id":"109870104","reply_id":"169014073442739713","base_reply_id":"169014073442739713"}],"avatar_url":"https://i.groupme.com/1272x1272.jpeg.b4b8469fb53148bda4649e6200d5653e","created_at":1690141158,"favorited_by":["109870104"],"group_id":"89961007","id":"169014115827858339","name":"Abigail Worstell","sender_id":"79745274","sender_type":"user","source_guid":"android-39c549de-d6a3-48f9-85bc-21ca12cea83e","system":false,"text":"Just think of them as kinda like a partial note.
