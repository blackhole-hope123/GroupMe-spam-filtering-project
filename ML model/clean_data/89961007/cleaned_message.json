Those are the top 3 on north campus imo. I think nosker also had a decent upright.\n\nThe one in blackburn is horrifically out of tune- or at least it was last year.\n\nThe grand piano in Raney is pretty old and not the best.\n\nTorres has an upright but it\u2019s pretty bad.\n\nDrackett has a really nice upright but something about it feels off when playing it, I think it\u2019s slightly out of tune.\n\nLincoln Tower has an upright that is similar in quality to the one at Torres.\n\nCanfield has a pretty bad grand piano.\n\nMack has an upright in its basement that is older than christmas and actually hilarious to play given how bad it is.\n\nJones, I think, had a pretty bad one but I can\u2019t remember- same with Patterson\n\nThat\u2019s the extent of the pianos i\u2019ve played on campus",

We are hoping to have bi-weekly meetings in the Sullivant Hall Collaboratory on Thursday 6:30-8 (ish), but day/time is subject to change based on building availability. \n\nLast semester, we around a piano and played piano for each other. We\u2019re planning on having themes (like Disney, classical, etc) to our meetings for this year. Additionally, we are working on setting up some sort of piano lessons for those who are new to piano and want to learn! \n\nBe on the lookout for announcements about our first meeting once the day and time is set in stone!

  "A few other suggestions would be the Dozen a Day series which helps build finger dexterity and strength, the Theory Time Music Theory series for learning and understanding the basics behind music theory and reading sheet music, and a book of scales that help to build understanding of music theory (start after finishing Thompson Grade 1).

  "Thank you both. ",
  "Just think of them as kinda like a partial note. They happen right before the note they go with and are really abrupt. The way i hear it is like ba-dum. I can send you a recording of me doing that measure if youd like.",
  "It depends piece to piece because sometimes you want to linger on the note a bit longer and sometimes make it a quick texture type thing.
