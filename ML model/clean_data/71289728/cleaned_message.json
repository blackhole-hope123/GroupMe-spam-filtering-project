  "rich\ud83d\udc80",
  "There\u2019s an easy solution for that. Get a second dishwasher that\u2019s used only for cleaning guns",
  "Stuck Water in gas tube could explode when fired",
  "Why would that impact a gas port? This is strictly hypothetical FYI - lots of auto parts with similar metallurgy go through dishwashers. It\u2019s one of the most cost effective parts cleaners. ",
  "This could also cause some issues on DI guns",
  "Also probably dont want to introduce lead and gunpowder residue into the thing used to wash things you eat off of",
  "Yeah, you need to oil them after but that goes for any cleaning.",
  "Rust ",
  "Actually now that I think of it - I can\u2019t think of a single good reason why running them thru the dishwasher wouldn\u2019t work (plastics & woods removed)",
  "It\u2019s definitely something that we will consider based on interest and availability. Or like griffin said you could become an Rso as well",
  "Just run em thru the dishwasher ",
  "When we clean our guns",
  "If you become an rso you can do it for free",
  "Thanks anyways",
  "I always found things like that interesting, guess I'll have to wait till I can actually buy my own firearm",
  "Unfortunate ",
  "but some youtube videos could be helpful if thats what you are looking for",
  "Sorry we don\u2019t teach that",
  "Will we ever learn how to do something like field stripping certain firearms, or cleaning them?",
  "I've been taking them :)",
  "Take your vitamin c gummies everyone ",
  "Also Allergies ",
  "It's almost flu and cold season as well lol",
  "With everyone back on campus people are catching all sorts of stuff",
  "So I probably caught something from someone ",
  "Yeah, I've heard multiple people in my classes cough ",
  "It is very very very unlikely that a sore throat is from the range",
  "My throat is a bit sore, should I be concerned? (This happened in the past after I went to a range) ",
  "Yay pistol club!!!",
  "Fix it or replace it. Glad you had fun!",
  "I'm probably gonna try to improve my pistol accuracy next time I come...and try the lever action rifle.",
  "But other than that, I had a lot of fun today!",
  "So what will you guys do with the M&P15-22 mag that kept jamming today?",
  "@Aadil Riaz Yes",
  "Are you guys still open?? This will be my second time coming ",
  "Classroom 239",
  "I guess that would be the room",
  "That\u2019s why I am asking ",
  "In a room with people ",
  "I am in floor 2 ",
  "Go upstairs ",
  "Hey what room is the safety training in?",
  "\u201cClose\u201d there have been days where we go to almost 11pm. Dw we will get everyone a chance to shoot. It should\u2019ve be too busy today",
  "The safety class will start promptly at 7pm on the second floor of converse hall. For those who have taken the class before this semester the range will also open at 7pm but feel free to arrive earlier (6:45 at the earliest) to secure a spot towards to beginning of the meeting",
  "What time is close?",
  "Ahh okay ",
  "I just got there at like 7 on the dot, and it seemed many people were already waiting",
  "So our club only has access to the range from 7-close on Wednesday nights.  There are other ranges near Columbus that allow for memberships and gun rental but you\u2019ll need to pay way more for that",
  "No",
  "For the safety class?",
  "7, but people seem to get there earlier",
  "Just to ask, what time is the meetings?",
  "Yep, you only hace to take 1 class per semester",
  "Also, once we do the class on Wednesday, can we only go to the range on Wednesday or any other day as well?",
  "(At least I think that's what you pay for?)",
  "Considering you're paying for the ammo I'd assume not",
  "Is there an option to buy lifetime range access",
  "And cash",
  "There's venmo",
  "For the club dues. Is it Cash or can we do Zelle or something like that.",
  "Oh okay thanks!",
  "As long as you bring your buck id",
  "A flight of stairs.",
  "Ok, and how far is it from the class to the range ",
  "Hey I just wanted to ask again. Can people who have graduated already. Come in to the meetings?",
  "But if you do the class, you'll definitely be able to go to the range afterwards",
  "Idk if it's canceled for 9/11... or something",
  "At least, I'm pretty sure",
  "Yes, and yes",
  "Is there a meeting today? Also if there is, after I go to the class can I go to the range?",
  "I wish there was tho.",
  "Till you took a bullet in the knee?",
  "This club is very fortunate to still be allowed to operate on OSU campus, given the university\u2019s views on guns, so the safety class is important to make sure everyone knows what they\u2019re doing and so that no one ruins things for everyone else.",
  "We used to be a proper school",
  "Not anymore atleast ",
  "Sorry about the jumpscare",
  "Nah OSU doesn\u2019t offer such class",
  "Ohhh, no I thought he meant like a class you can take for credit",
  "Did you go to range without taking a class?",
  "You do need to take a safety class if you are a new member and retake it every semester ",
  "There\u2019s a class???",
  "Sorry, i don\u2019t know if I\u2019m reading this correctly but do I need to take the class to be able to participate in the activities of this club?",
  "You can ask for a competition target ",
  "How do I join the weekly accuracy competition",
  "Yup",
  "Dope! Would my buckID get me and my s/o (graduated) in?",
  "Individual but we do have weekly accuracy competitions and a balloon shoot at the end of the semester for those who have attended the most",
  "More individual ",
  "Ayo! Trying to get a sense for how the club operates. Is this more of a team / competitive or individual come and go as you please? ",
  "I\u2019d only do it with an unloaded, no gas, air pistol",
  "Best way to get kicked out of any range.",
  "I can do it in RDR2",
  "Looks cool but is about the most unsafe thing one could do",
  "Can anyone do this?",
  "Absolutely! They\u2019d just have to take the class @7",
  "Can I bring my roommate this week?",
  "I might bring my roommate in the future; he's interested. But we're definitely arriving earlier!",
  "Ah okay",
  "Yes",
  "But do they have to take safety class as well?",
  "Yes as long as you present a valid buck ID",
  "Can we bring a guest to pistol club?",
  "That's a valid concern, giving what's on the news these day. ",
  "Unfortunately my dad said that people might attack me if i wear it out...since the logo's literally a target",
  "The patch design is so cool, perfect for my hat.",
  "Nvm, came back and got it",
  "What should I do?",
  "I left my backpack in the ROTC building",
  "Second floor there\u2019s a bunch of people up there waiting",
  "Should be on the second floor",
  "Go to second floor and turn left",
  "I can't find the way to.safety class",
  "If you knock someone should be able to let you in",
  "How can i come in?",
  "Im at the brutus statue",
  "Yes",
  "Do we have to take the safety class again even if we have taken it the previous semester?",
  "Go to second floor",
  "So we just wait at the first floor for the safety class?",

  "An interesting fact is (at least I'm pretty sure) 1 handed shooting was a lot more common wwi and wwii, even to the point of the creation of the jo lo  ar, which was specifically designed to be shot 1 handed for cavalry, and such, with a handle to pull back the slide. Though, The issue became putting in a new mag, or catching the old one",
  "@Matthew Elias One handed target shooting is at the discretion of the RSO working with you. It\u2019s a matter of showing competence. \n\nJust ask the RSO you are with after you\u2019ve been shooting for a bit",

  "Dylan I\u2019m sorry to hear about your arm.  I hope you have a speedy recovery on top of that, but I think it\u2019ll require both hands to safely experience our guns.  I would focus resting and healing.",

  "This message was deleted",
  "What about for this kind of issue?",
  "How late you stay depends on wait times and if you have done the training or not. The first meeting you attend takes the longest because you have to take the class on top of shooting on the range. ",
  "You can be a couple minutes late though",
  "Yeah, I guess that makes sense",
  "Well if there are not many people, there will be only one class",
  "I'm just a random member, lol, nowhere near an official",

  "How many rounds do we get to shoot? Sorry for the so many questions \ud83d\ude0c",
  "Except for your chances to shoot at the ROTC range, I guess",

  "ok, good to know",
  "You are allowed to swap guns ",
  "Sorry idk why I can\u2019t type tonight^^^ ",
  "With that being said you guys are allowed to swap out to request to swap which gun you want to shoot.  ",
  "After taking the class and showing you\u2019re able to work the Mk4 pistol confidently and controllably, you will earn the privilege to shooting our larger selection of rifles and other fun pistols",

  "If it\u2019s your first meeting yes otherwise no you are more than welcome to try out the inventory ",
  "Nope! ",
  "like, we choose 1 for the meeting? ",
  "so we stick with 1 gun for the whole time? ",
  "Yep sounds good. Feel free to ask us any and all question. We\u2019re more than happy to help",
  "Kinda random, but I've been running the proper way to load the ruger mk4 in my mind so as not to upset the instructors and I think I've got it down. It's mag, (aim, optional to aim here though), slide release, (aim if you didn't earlier), safety for loading, and safety, mag release, slide, then lock (if there's a round left), set down (ejection port up) for unloading, right?

  "Hey everyone! I hope you had a good spring break. \n\nOn April 3rd one of the guys I intern with is teaching an NRA basics handgun proficiency course from 8am to approximately 4pm. This includes 6 hours of classroom time and 2 hours of range time.\n\nFor those of you interested in getting your CCW in the near future this class is necessary for you. It is essentially a pre-requisite to the CCW qualification process that you would get at a range somewhere. It is necessary to have a certification in this before being able to get your CCW. \n\nIt is about $80ish (which is reasonable compared to other range pricing) the certification is included. If you have your own gun you are encouraged to bring it, however if you do not have one he has a few. You will need to bring about 100-150 rounds for the range time. If you are interested dm me separately and I can work on getting you signed up. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t 21 don\u2019t worry! The certification lasts for 3 years. \n",

  "Unfortunately for your first time you will have to sit through the class. I know we get a lot of first timers here that have prior experience with gun safety. It\u2019s our procedure. While I believe you, we have to treat everyone in the club equal regardless of experience. It\u2019s only about 30-40 minutes. The only reason I am doing it a little differently with Ethan is because S&I club did an event with us a couple weeks ago so he has already sat through the class, I am just giving him a touch up since he hasn\u2019t actually shot here yet. He isn\u2019t being treated special he just has unique circumstances. I know it\u2019s a pain sorry :/",
