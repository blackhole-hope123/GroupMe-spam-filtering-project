# project: GroupMe Spam filtering API

## Description

This project design a . This project used supervised learning to solve the captioned image recognition problem. A Convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained and evaluated on the dataset. Moreover, the project explores related phenomena such as overfitting and underfitting, as well as the impact of techniques such as Batch Normalization. A visualization of the CNN is also given.
